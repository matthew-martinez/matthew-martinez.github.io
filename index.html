    <section id="content">
      <p>I am a social scientist  based in the Washington, D.C. metro area. I am passionate about social science research methods, data science (in addition to other computational approaches to social research), and spatial analysis. I have expertise in human subjects research; statistical programming; survey and experimental design; data analysis and visualization; geospatial analysis; and social network analysis.</p>
      <p>I received my Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas where I focused on the emergence and stabilization of social norms and human cooperation and collective action. My dissertation took a mechanistic approach to understanding the influence of social organization, norms, and values (i.e., culture) on social, political, and economic attitudes and behaviors.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am a Research Associate working at <a href="http://www.prb.org">Population Reference Bureau</a> in the <a href="https://www.prb.org/program/us/">U.S. Programs department/a>. My research at PRB focuses on demographic, social, and economic patterns and trends and spatial demography within the United States. I also play an integral role in enhancing data visualization capabilities across the organization.</p>
      <p>I am proficient in several programming languages and software packages for statistical and scientific computing: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>R</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>SAS</li>
        <li>Stata</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I also have experience in multiple GIS software packages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ArcGIS (Pro and ArcMap)</li>
        <li>QGIS</li>
        <li>MapInfo</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More recently, I have become interested in web development and data visualization for communicating and disseminating research results. I am currently learning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux/Unix</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
